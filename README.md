# RPSLS-WeezsimS
A guy (nickname Weezsims) I was helping to learn C++ wrote this simple C++ code for school. To help motivate him, I created a simple android app out of it with his original c++ code handling the logic for the game.

# To run the app
- Find the [latest release](https://github.com/smac89/RPSLS-WeezsimS/releases)
- Download the correct version of the `app-<arch>-release.apk`. If you are unsure, `arm` will most likely be what your phone is running
- Enjoy!
